** USED FOR MOVIEBATTLES II ASSETS ONLY **

Created by: John
Dependencies: 7-Zip File Manager

1) Place and run in the root working directory of your repository.
2) Wait until it finishes and do not touch the terminal, it will take considerable time.
3) When separate Server and Client PK3s are created, users would possess only the client PK3.
4) Others who attempt to host the clientized files will find the FA gamemode to be broken, and unusable.

This is the only effective way to safeguard FA assets internally within PK3s, through abstract obsfucation.
Be humble with your creative works. Enjoy!
